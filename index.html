  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
    👋 Hi
  </p>

  <p>
  I studied in an Indian government school, in <strong>Telugu medium</strong>, where I grew up dreaming about space and wondering whether we are alone in the universe 🌌
  </p>

  <p>
    I was supported by a Rural Development Trust scholarship, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, which helped me
    study 11th and 12th standard, and later complete a four-year B.Tech in
    Mechanical Engineering. I finished my engineering degree in 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    During and after my engineering studies, I slowly realised that my interest
    was moving more towards physics and astronomy. Leaving mechanical engineering
    was not an easy decision, but I decided to prepare for CSIR–NET (JRF) and
    GATE in Physical Sciences and see where it would take me.
  </p>

  <p>
    That decision eventually brought me to the Indian Institute of Astrophysics
    (IIA). I joined the Integrated M.Tech-PhD program in Astronomical Instrumentation,
    completed my master’s degree, and am currently continuing my PhD in the
    same field.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like learning new things across different areas and working on problems
    that sit between physics, engineering, observations, and data analysis. I
    enjoy building things, figuring out how instruments work, and learning by
    doing.
  </p>
